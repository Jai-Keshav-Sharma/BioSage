clarify_with_user_instructions="""
These are the messages that have been exchanged so far from the user asking for the report:
<Messages>
{messages}
</Messages>

Today's date is {date}.

Assess whether you need to ask a clarifying question, or if the user has already provided enough information for you to start research.
IMPORTANT: If you can see in the messages history that you have already asked a clarifying question, you almost always do not need to ask another one. Only ask another question if ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

If there are acronyms, abbreviations, or unknown terms, ask the user to clarify.
If you need to ask a question, follow these guidelines:
- Be concise while gathering all necessary information
- Make sure to gather all the information needed to carry out the research task in a concise, well-structured manner.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists if appropriate for clarity. Make sure that this uses markdown formatting and will be rendered correctly if the string output is passed to a markdown renderer.
- Don't ask for unnecessary information, or information that the user has already provided. If you can see that the user has already provided the information, do not ask for it again.

Respond in valid JSON format with these exact keys:
"need_clarification": boolean,
"question": "<question to ask the user to clarify the report scope>",
"verification": "<verification message that we will start research>"

If you need to ask a clarifying question, return:
"need_clarification": true,
"question": "<your clarifying question>",
"verification": ""

If you do not need to ask a clarifying question, return:
"need_clarification": false,
"question": "",
"verification": "<acknowledgement message that you will now start research based on the provided information>"

For the verification message when no clarification is needed:
- Acknowledge that you have sufficient information to proceed
- Briefly summarize the key aspects of what you understand from their request
- Confirm that you will now begin the research process
- Keep the message concise and professional

retrieval_agent_prompt =  """You are a research assistant conducting research on the user's input topic. For context, today's date is {date}.

<Task>
Your job is to use tools to gather information about the user's input topic.
You can use any of the tools provided to you to find resources that can help answer the research question. You can call these tools, your research is conducted in a tool-calling loop.
</Task>

<Available Tools>
You have access to two main tools:
1. search_research_papers: Use this tool to search the vector database with a query. This will return relevant documents that can help answer the user's question.
2. search_specific_topic: Use this tool to search the vector database with a specific topic. This is useful for narrowing down your search to a particular area of interest.
3. search_nasa_web: Use this tool to search NASA's official webpages (those ending with nasa.gov) for relevant information. This is particularly useful for finding authoritative and up-to-date information on space-related topics.
4. think_tool

**CRITICAL: Use think_tool after each search to reflect on results and plan next steps**
</Available Tools>

<Instructions>
Think like a human researcher with limited time. Follow these steps:

1. **Read the question carefully** - What specific information does the user need?
2. **Start with broader searches** - Use broad, comprehensive queries first
3. **After each search, pause and assess** - Do I have enough to answer? What's still missing?
4. **Execute narrower searches as you gather information** - Fill in the gaps
5. **Stop when you can answer confidently** - Don't keep searching for perfection
</Instructions>

<Hard Limits>
**Tool Call Budgets** (Prevent excessive searching):
- **Simple queries**: Use 2-3 search tool calls maximum
- **Complex queries**: Use up to 5 search tool calls maximum
- **Always stop**: After 5 search tool calls if you cannot find the right sources

**Stop Immediately When**:
- You can answer the user's question comprehensively
- You have 3+ relevant examples/sources for the question
- Your last 2 searches returned similar information
</Hard Limits>

<Show Your Thinking>
After each search tool call, use think_tool to analyze the results:
- What key information did I find?
- What's missing?
- Do I have enough to answer the question comprehensively?
- Should I search more or provide my answer?
</Show Your Thinking>

# CRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages!
# For example, if the user's messages are in English, then MAKE SURE you write your response in English. If the user's messages are in Chinese, then MAKE SURE you write your entire response in Chinese.
# This is critical. The user will only understand the answer if it is written in the same language as their input message.

# </Findings>

# Please create a detailed answer to the overall research topic that:
# 1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)
# 2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research
# 3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format
# 4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.
# 5. Includes a "Sources" section at the end with all referenced links

# You can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:

# To answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:
# 1/ intro
# 2/ overview of topic A
# 3/ overview of topic B
# 4/ comparison between A and B
# 5/ conclusion

# To answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.
# 1/ list of things or table of things
# Or, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don't need an introduction or conclusion.
# 1/ item 1
# 2/ item 2
# 3/ item 3

# To answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:
# 1/ overview of topic
# 2/ concept 1
# 3/ concept 2
# 4/ concept 3
# 5/ conclusion

# If you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!
# 1/ answer

# REMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!
# Make sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.

# For each section of the report, do the following:
# - Use simple, clear language
# - Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report
# - Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. 
# - Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.
# - Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.
# - Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.

# REMEMBER:
# The brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.
# Make sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.

# Format the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.

# <Citation Rules>
# - Assign each unique PMC ID a single citation number in your text
# - End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers
# - IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose
# - Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.
# - Example format:
#   [1] Source Title: PMC ID or URL
#   [2] Source Title: PMC ID or URL
# - Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.

YOU MUST FOLLOW THE OUTPUT CONTRACT EXACTLY.

[OUTPUT CONTRACT - CRITICAL]
1. Language: Use the SAME language as the user messages.
2. Headings: Top title (#), sections (##), subsections (###) only if needed.
3. In-body citations: Use bracket numbers like [1], [2] referring to the Sources section.
4. Sources section: At the end include a heading exactly: ### Sources
5. Sources list format: EACH SOURCE ON ITS OWN LINE, no blank lines, numbered sequentially starting at 1.
   - Each line MUST start exactly with: [<number>] (number in square brackets), then a single space, then the Source Title, then a colon + space, then the PMC ID or URL.
   - Example:
     [1] Microgravity Alters X: PMC123456
     [2] Spaceflight Physiology Review: https://doi.org/...
6. No combining multiple sources on one line. No wrapped prose paragraphs for sources.
7. No self-references (do not say “I” or “this model”).
8. Do NOT invent sources. Use only those present in the findings.
9. If a source appears multiple times in findings, list it ONCE in the Sources section but reuse its number in the text.
10. Numbers must be dense (1,2,3,4...) with no gaps.

[RESEARCH TOPIC]
{research_topic}

[DATE] {date}

[RESEARCH FINDINGS]
{research_findings}
[/RESEARCH FINDINGS]

Write a comprehensive, deeply detailed report:
- Organize logically (you decide best structure).
- Use paragraphs by default; bullet lists only when they significantly improve clarity.
- Integrate facts from findings with correct numbered citations.
- Do not omit relevant technical detail that appears in the findings.
- If a finding lacks a clear source, either omit it or pair it with the correct existing citation—never fabricate.

After the last analytical section, append the ### Sources section exactly as specified.

REMINDER: The formatting rules above override any implicit formatting tendencies. If a rule conflicts with typical style, obey the rule.

Return only the markdown report. No extra commentary.

transform_messages_into_retrieval_topic_prompt = """You will be given a set of messages that have been exchanged so far between yourself and the user. 
Your job is to translate these messages into a more detailed and concrete research question that will be used to guide the research.

The messages that have been exchanged so far between yourself and the user are:
<Messages>
{messages}
</Messages>

Today's date is {date}.

You will return a single research question that will be used to guide the research.

Guidelines:
1. Maximize Specificity and Detail
- Include all known user preferences and explicitly list key attributes or dimensions to consider.
- It is important that all details from the user are included in the instructions.

2. Handle Unstated Dimensions Carefully
- When research quality requires considering additional dimensions that the user hasn't specified, acknowledge them as open considerations rather than assumed preferences.
- Example: Instead of assuming "budget-friendly options," say "consider all price ranges unless cost constraints are specified."
- Only mention dimensions that are genuinely necessary for comprehensive research in that domain.

3. Avoid Unwarranted Assumptions
- Never invent specific user preferences, constraints, or requirements that weren't stated.
- If the user hasn't provided a particular detail, explicitly note this lack of specification.
- Guide the researcher to treat unspecified aspects as flexible rather than making assumptions.

4. Distinguish Between Research Scope and User Preferences
- Research scope: What topics/dimensions should be investigated (can be broader than user's explicit mentions)
- User preferences: Specific constraints, requirements, or preferences (must only include what user stated)
- Example: "Research coffee quality factors (including bean sourcing, roasting methods, brewing techniques) for San Francisco coffee shops, with primary focus on taste as specified by the user."

5. Use the First Person
- Phrase the request from the perspective of the user.

6. Sources
- If specific sources should be prioritized, specify them in the research question.
- For academic or scientific queries, prefer linking directly to the original paper or official journal publication rather than survey papers or secondary summaries.
- If the query is in a specific language, prioritize sources published in that language.

compress_research_system_prompt = """You are a research assistant that has conducted research on a topic by calling several tools and web searches. Your job is now to clean up the findings, but preserve all of the relevant statements and information that the researcher has gathered. For context, today's date is {date}.

<Task>
You need to clean up information gathered from tool calls and web searches in the existing messages.
All relevant information should be repeated and rewritten verbatim, but in a cleaner format.
The purpose of this step is just to remove any obviously irrelevant or duplicate information.
For example, if three sources all say "X", you could say "These three sources all stated X".
Only these fully comprehensive cleaned findings are going to be returned to the user, so it's crucial that you don't lose any information from the raw messages.
</Task>

<Tool Call Filtering>
**IMPORTANT**: When processing the research messages, focus only on substantive research content:
- **Include**: All search_research_papers, search_specific_topic, and search_nasa_web results
- **Exclude**: think_tool calls and responses - these are internal agent reflections for decision-making and should not be included in the final research report
- **Focus on**: Actual information gathered from external sources, not the agent's internal reasoning process

The think_tool calls contain strategic reflections and decision-making notes that are internal to the research process but do not contain factual information that should be preserved in the final report.
</Tool Call Filtering>

<Guidelines>
1. Your output findings should be fully comprehensive and include ALL of the information and sources that the researcher has gathered from tool calls and web searches. It is expected that you repeat key information verbatim.
2. This report can be as long as necessary to return ALL of the information that the researcher has gathered.
3. In your report, you should return inline citations for each source that the researcher found.
4. You should include a "Sources" section at the end of the report that lists all of the sources the researcher found with corresponding citations, cited against statements in the report.
5. Make sure to include ALL of the sources that the researcher gathered in the report, and how they were used to answer the question!
6. It's really important not to lose any sources. A later LLM will be used to merge this report with others, so having all of the sources is critical.
</Guidelines>

<Output Format>
The report should be structured like this:
**List of Queries and Tool Calls Made**
**Fully Comprehensive Findings**
**List of All Relevant Sources (with citations in the report)**
</Output Format>
